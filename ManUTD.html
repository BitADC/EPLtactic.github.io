        <h2 class="h2">Manchester United: overcome difficulties </h2>
        <p class="p0">Before the EPL (season 2022-2023) begin, Manchester United have a change with the coach when their interim coach which is Ralf Rangnick changed to position of athletic director and the coach that being chosen to lead Manchester United during this season (2022-2023) is Erik ten Hag. To analyse the strategy of Erik ten Hag applied to Manchester United in this season, we divided the journey of Manchester United after the first half of the season into 3 period: idyllic phase, the passive phase and the Longterm phase.</p>
        <p class="p1">Let see how Erik ten Hag changed Manchester United </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over"> Idyllic phase </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/ManUTD/Capture.JPG">
            <p class="p2">The idyllic phase includes the first 2 matches of EPL 2022-2023 which was Manchester United vs Brighton and Manchester United vs Brentford. Unfortunately, the team led by Erik ten Hag has not had good result against Brighton and Brentford when they lost both matches with 1-2 and 0-4. During this phase, ten Hag tried to apply his old tactic from Ajax. The style of ten Hag during this period is High possession + High pressing with the foundation of 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 and his new team get the serious problems in both criteria.  </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/ManUTD/Capture1.JPG">
            <p class="p2">Firstly, to deploy attack from home side Manchester United players must use short pass in “ten Hag ball” but the goalkeeper and the Centre defend midfielder of Manchester United which is David de Gea and Fred not good at passing and ball distribution. This problem causes the system of Erik ten Hag can’t work efficiently and the mistakes in passing always put Manchester United in a dangerous position such as the first and second goal of Brentford in the first 15 minutes of the game. The other problem is the High pressing system of “ten Hag ball” applied to Manchester United in this phase, when they need to have a high compact line in defenders, but the defenders of this team can’t fully grasp the structure this system and Maquire not a form of defender who quickly, so it becomes easier for the opponents to counterattack Manchester United such as the last goal of Brentford.       </p> 
            
        </div>
        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over">Passive phase   </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/ManUTD/Capture2.JPG">
            <p class="p2">The passive phase includes the next 5 matches of Manchester United, when they met the harder opponents which is Arsenal, Leicester City, Liverpool, Manchester City, and Southampton. Erik ten hag had changed his tactic for this period when Manchester United style become more pragmatic to immediate get the better results that give him enough time to prepare for long term change. During this phase, ball possession of Manchester United have been decreased when they have changed some position in the main line-up when Malacia will play at left back position, Rashford will have the role of Centre Forward which is striker, Varane will replace Maquire and Eriksen will play deeper as ball-pull midfielder in the formation of 4-2-3-1.  To avoid counterattacks from the opponent, Manchester United start in the mid-block instead of high block like the beginning, this will avoid the long pass because the defenders can cover the space at the home side otherwise, they will not high pressing anymore when they will choose counterattack as the main style. To counterattack the opponent, they will move their formation to 4-5-1 when defend, this causes the opponent to have a problem in attack so they need to move left and right wing back position forward to increase the number of players attacking, the space will appear behind left and right wing back when they move up, so long-pass will be the priority of Manchester United because their players can’t do well in short pass and to take advantage of Rashford's speed in quick counter-attacks.</p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/ManUTD/Capture3.JPG">
            <p class="p2">They got the better results with 4 wins and only 1 lost against Manchester City otherwise the goal difference expects got better even they met the stronger opponents during this phase.   </p>
        </div> 
        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over"> Longterm phase  </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/ManUTD/Capture5.JPG">
            <p class="p2">The Longterm phase includes the remaining matches when Manchester United need to use the long-term tactic to get the good result in this season despite the bad results they got in the idyllic phase. Erik ten Hag had some changes in the main line-up with Luke Shaw come back in the left wing back position, Casemiro replaced Fred and the new player Anthony will claim the right forward position. The plan of Erik ten Hag in this phase is to balance the tactics from idyllic phase and passive phase when they will apply more short passes with the improved of David de Gea and the replacement of Luke Shaw </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/ManUTD/Capture4.JPG">
            <p class="p2">When they attack and distribute the ball to the 2/3 of the field, Luke Shaw will be the player who will do it when he has enough space, he will progress the ball into midfield region or Eriksen will be the one who do the ball distribution when he dropping to the midfield to replace Casemiro or even replace the position of Luke Shaw. The ability of Casemiro is outclasses Fred and McTominay when his defend ability is enough to help Bruno Fernades and Eriksen can move up higher to create more chances because one of them needs to move back in the first two phases when they don't have Casemiro behind them.   </p> 
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/ManUTD/a3e73ed1b8b20d739ce65398a66f2dfb.jpg">
            <p class="p2">The new player which is Anthony also an important factor of tactic of Manchester United when this player is good at one versus one situation with good dribbling ability, he can combine with Dalot to disturb the opponent players to create more chances in the right side. That's how Erik ten Hag form the style of Manchester United, they will have at least 3 players at the back with the support from Casemiro when the opponent counterattacks, one of the greatest defend midfielders in the football history. </p>
