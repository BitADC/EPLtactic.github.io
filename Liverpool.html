        <h2 class="h2">Liverpool: Old problem </h2>
        <p class="p0">After 2021/22 season, Liverpool encountered a lot of personnel and tactical problems when their results at the beginning of this season were extremely bad when they only ranked 11 out of 20 after the first 5 matches of EPL, and this is one of the worst starts of Liverpool in this league. At the middle of the season, Liverpool had come back from rank 11 to rank 6 on the table but there is still a lot of problems and Jurgen Klopp who is the coach of Liverpool can’t fix. </p>
        <p class="p1">Let find out what tactical problems that Liverpool has in this season in on all three lines.   </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over"> Overview </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Liverpool/Capture.JPG">
            <p class="p2">First, the formation that Liverpool will use is 4-2-3-1 with Alisson will be the Goalkeeper, the defenders from left to right include: Robertson (Tsimikas) – Van Dijk – Matip – Arnold, the Henderson and Thiago in the Centre Defensive Midfielders, the ‘False 9’ will be Jota with Right and Left Forward are Salah and Diaz, with the Central Forward is Nunez.   </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Liverpool/Capture1.JPG">
            <p class="p2">Second, the style of Liverpool is Gegen-pressing which mean they will highly be pressing the defenders of the opponent because with 3 attackers and 1 ‘False 9’ they will press to the central defenders by the numerical advantage. The 2 side attackers will have the mission to pressing to 2 central defenders, the central strikers will cut the pass between 2 of them and the false 9 will cut the pass from the to the central midfielders, it’s mean that Liverpool will try to Lock the space of these players.  </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Liverpool/Capture2.JPG">
            <p class="p2">When they have the ball, Liverpool will try to attack from 2 Full backs move up with the high passes or the long shots, otherwise if Liverpool Counterattack the false 9 will move up equal to the main striker, the left and right Forward will move widely close to the border in two sides to create more space for the Central Forward and the False 9, they will have 2v1 or 2v2 scenarios with a lot of space to dribbling. That’s how the basic system of Liverpool work when they defend and attack. </p> 
        </div>
        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over"> Problems </h3>
            <p class="p2">As the text has mentioned, Liverpool encountered a lot of tactical problems which cause them to fall out of top 6 at the beginning of the season, so what the tactical problems that they have?  </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Arsenal/Capture1.JPG">
            <p class="p2">First, the disadvantage of Gegen-pressing has been showed in the match against Arsenal when Liverpool loses 2-3 goals and all 3 goals of Arsenal come from the missing in the number of players in defend because Arsenal actively pressing to the defenders of Liverpool, so they always have at least 5 players when rotating the ball to counterattack. Even Arnold and Robertson avoid moving up and try to play deeper to defend but Liverpool still missing people, especially in the first goal of Arsenal when Arnold need to 1v3 in the right side, and he have no chance to defend and steal the ball back.  </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Liverpool/Capture3.JPG">
            <p class="p2">Second, the problem Liverpool usually related to missing people in the defend position,the second problem is appeared when the Full backs moves up to support the attack and when the counterattack happen, they are missing players to lock the spaces behind the wing backs. The match lost against Manchester United show this problem, when Elanga always move nearly the space behind Arnold when he move up and with the good passing skills of Eriksen, Manchester United successfully to use the weak point in the tactic of Liverpool. It’s caused Henderson need to move back to lock that space and he can't participate in attack as usual.  </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Liverpool/fab-thiago-hendo-keita.jpg">
            <p class="p2">Third, the Personnel problems of Liverpool in the Forward and Midfield lines when they don’t have the good players in that position. As you know, the midfielders of Liverpool are too old right (around 30-year-old) now and they can’t ensure their durability and strength to dispute in the midfield when change to formation of 4-3-3 and the ‘False 9’ need to move back to support them. This affects the attack tempo of Liverpool, when this one become slower and the new players which is Nunez and Jota also not meet the needs of Klopp after transfer Mane to Munich, because they don’t have a good skill of dribbling in the narrow space. This also effect to the tempo of Liverpool, and they need to fix it if they want to move up to top 4. </p>
