        <h2 class="h2">Tottenham: When tactics are disabled  </h2>
        <p class="p0">In this season 2022/23, Tottenham took the 5th place in the ranking of EPL after 17 matches and if you only look at the ranking, you can't Identify the problems of Tottenham.Therefore, Tottenham's performance is unstable when the last 5 matches have the result of 2 wins, 2 lose, and 1 draw while the other clubs in Big 6 clubs have the better performance with at least 3 wins and none of them have more than 1 lose. As of January 1, 2023, Tottenham vs Newcastle is the only two teams with 17 consecutive matches, since the Newcastle is undefeated in the last 5 matches. Is Antonio Conte's tactics nullified? </p>
        <p class="p1">Let analyse the tactic the Conte apply to Tottenham currently with their advantages and disadvantages</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over"> Overview </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Tottenham/Line up.webp">
            <p class="p2">In this season, Tottenham usually start with the formation of 3-4-3 with Lloris will protect the goal as a Goalkeeper, Lenglet-Dier-Romero will collaborate to be the “back 3” of Tottenham, the wings back will be Perisic and Spence while the Central Midfielder will be Bentancur-Bissouma , Kane will play on top while Son and Richarlison will be Left and Right Forward </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Tottenham/Attack.JPG">
            <p class="p2">When Spurs need to attack, they will transform into 4-4-2 then they will move up 2 Full back and 2 Wings back high up the pitch, if this situation happen the formation of Tottenham will become 2-2-6. The reason why they move up 2 Full Backs and 2 Wing Backs is they want to attack from the flanks instead of half space or central , with the numerical advantage with at least 2 players in one side , sometime Son and Kane also move widely to create a triangle in one side , if this happens the wings back will move to the half- space to help the other strikers to dispute the ball from the cross from their teammate. In case that they are Counterattack, Kane will be the player will move back as a "False9" and he will usually be the recipient of the ball while Son and Richarlison move forward so Kane can deliver the ball to their space because both son and Richarlison is kind of player who have enough speed for counterattack.   </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Tottenham/Capture4.JPG">
            <p class="p2">When Spurs met the stronger opponents such as Manchester City or Liverpool , those opponent players have a good skill to disable the pressing tactic of Tottenham, so they choose to change the formation to 5-3-2 or 5-4-1 when the wingers need to move down to play with the position of 2 Full Backs , otherwise , 1 or both Wing Forwards need to play deeper as wingers, their aim is to lock all the space in the defence and limit those teams to use long shots. They will have enough player in the half-space where most of the team use the formation of 2-3-5 to attack, when the Central midfielders can move back to marking the playmaker of the opponent such as De Bruyne or Odeegard, if they can mark the playmaker , it’s difficult to the opponents to deliver the ball to the penalty area accurately to the strikers. With those teams such as Liverpool, they have the good attack Full Backs to cross the ball into the box accurately, Spurs can also mark them with at least 2 players ( wing backs and Full backs ).  </p>

        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over"> Advantages </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Tottenham/tactical-board.com (6).png">
            <p class="p2">1) When Tottenham attack, they always have at least 2 players in one side when the Full backs and Wingers move up to support the attack , and they will have at least 2 players in the box to receive the ball have been crossed from two side. When they change to 2-2-6 , they don’t need to worry that they will missing people if they attack , this is numerical advantage.  </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Tottenham/tactical-board.com (7).png">
            <p class="p2">2) When they defend, they change to the formation of 5-4-1 or 5-3-2 so they always have 5 players at the back, when the opponent attack they will have enough players in the box to dispute with the ball. They can collaborate with the midfielders to pressing the playmaker of the opponent, cause them hard to possess the ball. With 5 defenders, Tottenham can avoid long shot from the opponent.     </p>

        <div class="AnaTot2">

            <h3 id="h3over"> Disadvantages </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Tottenham/tactical-board.com (9).png">
            <p class="p2">1) The disadvantage when Tottenham attack is it too easy to counterattack when both side of wing backs and Full backs move up , the space behind is too large and the central defenders can lock all the space. In this season, Tottenham usually let the opponents score the first goal, that’s the problem of Tottenham when they attack with the formation 2-2-6.    </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Tottenham/tactical-board.com (8).png">
            <p class="p2">2) When they defend with the formation 5-4-1 with the stronger opponents , the ball possession of them always lower than 40% , they move the defend wall deeper , even they have 4 midfielders, but the wingers need to defence the area on two sides , so there’s only 2 players in the central which mean they can dispute the ball with opponents when they play 4-3-3 or other formation with at least 3 central midfielders.        </p>
