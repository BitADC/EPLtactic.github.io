        <h2 class="h2">Manchester City: More Perfect</h2>
        <p class="p0">Manchester City have had a successful season with when they achieve the championship in the last EPL season (2021/22), and their goal in this EPL season nothing but to save the championship. They keep their coach from the last season which is Pep Guardiola and make some changes in this season in tactic with the addition from the summer's transfer window especially when Erling Halland transfers from Dortmund to Manchester City, the attack style of Manchester City have significantly change, it become more pragmatic. To have a clearly understanding about how it changes, we will divide the tactic of Manchester City into 2 parts: when they have the ball and when they don't. </p>
        <p class="p1">Let find out how Guardiola transform Manchester City in this season   </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over"> When they have the ball </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Mancity/Capture.JPG">
            <p class="p2">In this season, Manchester City usually start with the formation of 4-2-3-1 with Enderson in the position of Goalkeeper, Walker-Dias(Stones)-Ake-Cancelo as the defenders then Rodri-Gundogan- Mahrez (or Bernado Silva)- Foden as midfielders, De Bruyne will be Central Forward and Haaland will be the player who play at the highest position  </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Mancity/Capture1.JPG">
            <p class="p2">When they have the ball, the formation will transform to 2-3-5 with the move up of all midfielders except Rodri and their wing backs will move to the center to support Rodri.  Manchester City will have a lot of space in 2 sides when De Bruyne, Halland and Gundogan move closer to the penalty area or when Halland stretch the defender, De Bruyne and Gundogan will have enough space to make dangerous slits for the flanks or shoot shots close to the box. In fact, most of the attack come from the left side of Manchester City because ball possession is not an advantage of Kyle Walker, therefore, to reduce the chance of Counterattack from the opponent they will prefer to attack in the left side where both Cancelo and Foden are players who good at dribbling and passing. </p> 
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Mancity/Capture3.JPG">
            <p class="p2">The advantage of this tactic is the numerical advantage when all 5 Manchester City players cause the pressure in the defend of opponents, this situation happen to create the positional overload and when they stretch the defend it will create the passing line or the space to make slits. The slits usually come from De Bruyne and Gundogan with the target is Foden – Mahrez- Halland  </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Mancity/Capture4.JPG">
            <p class="p2">The disadvantages of this formation are the counterattack of the opponent when they press the midfielder of Manchester City such as the goal of Newcastle against them, when Maximin use his speed to attack to the space behind Kyle Walker when Walker move to midline and cause the defenders of Manchester City which is Stones and Ake can't react with the situation, 2/3 goals of New Castle again Manchester City come from the support of Maximin.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="AnaTot2">
            <h3 id="h3over"> When they don't control the ball  </h3>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Mancity/Capture5.JPG">
            <p class="p2">In this season, Manchester City keep the same style of defend with the previous seasons but with the participation of Halland, Pep Guardiola have changed some positions when they do the high pressing. When the opponent has the ball, they will be pressing in the defender by Gundogan and De Bruyne instead of Halland, Halland will move back as the Centre Forward because in case that De Bruyne and Gundogan can take the ball from the opponent they can pass back to Halland who have enough space to make a shot , otherwise Foden will pressing in one side and the other side will be Cancelo , so Kyle Walker will move back to avoid the long pass from the Goalkeeper. Some of the team in EPL have a good ball possession ability can get over the high pressing from Manchester City such as Liverpool or Arsenal, in case they can move the ball up to the midline of the field, Manchester City will change their formation to 3-6-1 to press to the midfielders of the opponent and they will have the numerical advantage by this formation. </p>
            <img class="imgTot0" src="/Images/Mancity/download.jfif">
            <p class="p2">Second, the problem Liverpool usually related to missing people in the defend position,the second problem is appeared when the Full backs moves up to support the attack and when the counterattack happen, they are missing players to lock the spaces behind the wing backs. The match lost against Manchester United show this problem, when Elanga always move nearly the space behind Arnold when he move up and with the good passing skills of Eriksen, Manchester United successfully to use the weak point in the tactic of Liverpool. It’s caused Henderson need to move back to lock that space and he can't participate in attack as usual.  </p>
